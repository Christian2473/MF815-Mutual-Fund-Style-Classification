Principal Investment Strategies

The fund’s asset allocation strategy seeks to diversify its investments among equity securities, debt securities, U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed securities, commodity-related investments and real estate-related investments, all in an effort to provide investors total real return. Total real return is total return reduced by the expected impact of inflation. The fund’s investment strategy has been designed in an effort to protect the fund’s investors from the effects of rising U.S. inflation. The portfolio managers will regularly review the fund’s asset mix and adjust the allocation among asset classes as necessary to provide the fund what they believe is the most favorable outlook for achieving the fund’s objective. By adjusting the allocation among asset classes the portfolio managers can moderate risks associated with each asset category.",Balanced Fund (Low Risk)

**Macro Analysis:**

The Janus Henderson Asia Equity Fund is focused on investing in common stocks within the Asian equity market. This strategy aligns it with the ""Equity Long Only"" category, as it primarily seeks to capitalize on the growth potential of equities in the region. 

**Key Themes and Issues:**

1. **Economic Growth in Asia:** Many Asian economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, are experiencing robust growth driven by factors such as urbanization, a growing middle class, and technological advancements. This growth can lead to increased corporate earnings, benefiting equity investors.

2. **Geopolitical Risks:** The region is subject to various geopolitical tensions, including trade disputes and territorial conflicts, particularly involving major economies like China and the U.S. These tensions can create volatility in the markets and impact investor sentiment.

3. **Regulatory Environment:** Different countries in Asia have varying regulatory frameworks that can affect business operations and profitability. Investors need to be aware of changes in regulations that could impact specific sectors, such as technology or finance.

4. **Market Volatility:** As noted, common stocks tend to be more volatile than other investment choices. The fund's focus on equities means it is exposed to market fluctuations, which can be influenced by global economic conditions, interest rates, and investor sentiment.

5. **Currency Risks:** Investing in Asian equities also exposes the fund to currency risk, as fluctuations in exchange rates can impact returns for foreign investors.

**Regional Market Risks:**

- **Emerging Market Risks:** Many Asian markets are classified as emerging markets, which can be more susceptible to economic shocks, political instability, and changes in global capital flows.
- **Sector-Specific Risks:** The fund may be concentrated in certain sectors that are more sensitive to economic cycles, such as technology or consumer discretionary, which can lead to higher volatility.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Changes in interest rates, particularly in major economies like the U.S., can impact capital flows into Asia and affect equity valuations.

Overall, while the Janus Henderson Asia Equity Fund has the potential for significant returns due to the growth prospects in Asia, it also faces considerable risks that investors must consider.","also analyze each company from a macro perspective taking into consideration any important themes or issues that may impact the investment environment in certain regions or sectors and to estimate regional market risks. The Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking an Asian equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices. 3 	Janus Henderson Asia Equity Fund",Equity Long Only (Low Risk)

The fund may hire, terminate or replace subadvisers and modify material terms and conditions of subadvisory arrangements without shareholder approval.

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund will generally invest in larger-sized companies using a quantitative model that combines fundamental measures of a stock’s value and growth potential. To measure value, the managers may use ratios of stock price-to-earnings and stock price-to-cash flow, among others. To measure growth, the managers may use the rate of growth of a company’s earnings and cash flow and changes in its earnings estimates, as well as other factors. The model also considers price momentum. The portfolio managers also take environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") factors into account in making investment decisions.  The portfolio managers attempt to build a portfolio of stocks that provides better returns than, and a dividend yield comparable to, the S&P 500® Index, without taking on significant additional risk.
